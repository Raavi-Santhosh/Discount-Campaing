# Discount-Campaing

A retail banking institution is going to float a stock trading facility for their existing customer. Since this kind of facitlity is nothing new , company knows that they will have to incetivise their customers for adopting their offerings. One way to incetiwise is to offer discounts on the commision for trading transactions.

One issue with that is that only about 10% of the customers do enought trades for earnings after discounts to be profitable. Company wants to figure out, which are those 10% customer so that it can selectively offer them discount. there is no magic way to figure that out. So company rolled out this service to about 10000+ of their customers and observed their trading behaviour for 6 months and after that they labelled them into two revenue.grids 1 and 2. using this data, now they want us to build a classification model which can be used to classify their remaining customers into these revenue grids.
